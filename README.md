# BetterVOTE
Project for ByteHacks 2020

## Inspiration
For ByteHacks’ theme, we had to come up with an app that solved a problem during a historical event. Our team’s chosen historical event is the 1898 Canadian prohibition plebiscite. This was the first nationwide referendum in Canadian history. This was a divisive topic and the vote in favour of the proposed legislation won by a slight margin, but ultimately, the Canadian government decided not to implement it due to only 44% voter turnout.

We wanted to make an app that would have had the potential to increase voter turnout, as well as eliminate more barriers that stand in the way of votes such as voter suppression tactics, and reduce the time and cost that goes into a referendum.
